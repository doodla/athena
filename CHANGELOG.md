# Changelog

All notable changes to Athena are recorded in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0]

The first version: the v0 walking skeleton. It takes one request, runs one job through a sub-agent,
verifies the result with a separate agent, and lands one traceable commit with secret scanning on.

### Added

- A Rust workspace split into focused crates, with the dependency direction documented in
  `docs/architecture.md` and checked by a test: `athena-data`, `athena-score`, `athena-git`,
  `athena-gate`, `athena-context`, `athena-agent`, `athena-core`, `athena-cap-change`, `athena-cli`,
  and `xtask`.
- The `athena` command: `ask`, `correct`, `go`, `close`, `status`, `intervene`, `restart`, `check`,
  `stop`, and `start`. Every command accepts `--json`. `athena --version` prints the package version
  and the commit the binary was built from.
- The request flow. A reader turns a request into a reading: a summary, acceptance criteria,
  deliverables, and forecasts. The user accepts it with Enter or corrects it in one line. A producer
  then makes the change in a detached snapshot, Athena runs the checks (fmt, clippy, tests), and a
  separate verifier judges the exact candidate.
- Landing. A change that passes is committed once, with its records, and the branch moves by
  fast-forward only. A change that fails is closed with its findings.
- The `change` capability, the only kind of work v0 can do.
- Records. Jobs, predictions, interventions, restarts, and scores are stored as plain JSON under
  `records/`, documented in `docs/records.md`. Unknown fields are rejected when records are read.
- A commit gate that every commit passes. It scans for secrets with gitleaks, checks that records are
  valid and append-only, and checks size and personal data.
- Scoring of predictions with proper scoring rules (Brier, log-scale weighted interval score,
  and a summed deliverable score), compared against a reference forecast.
- Cost and token capture for every model call made through Claude Code.
- `setup.sh`, an idempotent, version-pinned setup. It reads its versions from `athena.toml` and
  `rust-toolchain.toml`, checks downloads against pinned SHA-256 sums, and never stores credentials.
- Documentation: `README.md`, `BRIEF.md` (the requirements), `docs/architecture.md`,
  `docs/design/athena-v0.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/enforcement.md`, `docs/records.md`, and
  `docs/non-rust-files.md`.
