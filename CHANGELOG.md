# Changelog

All notable changes to Athena are recorded in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `athena ask "try again on <job>"` retries a rejected job. The reader's brief gains an "Earlier attempt"
  section with that job's request and its final verification's findings (redacted); the new job's own
  request stays as typed. A job that is not rejected, or is unknown, is refused with an error naming it.

- Independent review 1 of the study capability M1 design
  (`docs/design/reviews/study-capability-m1-review-1.md`): approve with changes, 7 major findings, answered
  checks 1–8 of the design's §9. The design's status line links to it. No code changed.

### Changed

- The governed-content invariant and `athena check --history` now accept a landing that was squash-merged
  or rebase-merged, as well as a merge commit. A landing is identified by the job records the commit adds,
  not by `Athena-*` trailers or by the prediction commit being an ancestor. "Prediction before work" is
  proved from the records: the accepted reading must be recorded before the dispatch and before every
  producer and verifier invocation. A trailer that contradicts the records still refuses the landing;
  `Athena-Prediction` is no longer checked, and the `prediction` rule no longer reports. A second landing
  of a job is found from the parent's records and the history walk, not from trailers. See design §7.3.

- `athena check --history` now reads `[history] exempt` from the tip's `athena.toml`, so an entry added
  after the commit it names takes effect. Before, each commit was judged by its parent's list, which could
  never hold such an entry. An entry still must be a full commit id already in history, so it cannot cover
  a later commit. Per-commit checks are unchanged.

## [0.1.0]

The first version: the v0 walking skeleton. It takes one request, runs one job through a sub-agent,
verifies the result with a separate agent, and lands one traceable commit with secret scanning on.

### Added

- A Rust workspace split into focused crates, with the dependency direction documented in
  `docs/architecture.md` and checked by a test: `athena-data`, `athena-score`, `athena-git`,
  `athena-gate`, `athena-context`, `athena-agent`, `athena-core`, `athena-cap-change`, `athena-cli`,
  and `xtask`.
- The `athena` command: `ask`, `correct`, `go`, `close`, `status`, `intervene`, `restart`, `check`,
  `stop`, and `start`. Every command accepts `--json`. `athena --version` prints the package version
  and the commit the binary was built from.
- The request flow. A reader turns a request into a reading: a summary, acceptance criteria,
  deliverables, and forecasts. The user accepts it with Enter or corrects it in one line. A producer
  then makes the change in a detached snapshot, Athena runs the checks (fmt, clippy, tests), and a
  separate verifier judges the exact candidate.
- Landing. A change that passes is committed once, with its records, and the branch moves by
  fast-forward only. A change that fails is closed with its findings.
- The `change` capability, the only kind of work v0 can do.
- Records. Jobs, predictions, interventions, restarts, and scores are stored as plain JSON under
  `records/`, documented in `docs/records.md`. Unknown fields are rejected when records are read.
- A commit gate that every commit passes. It scans for secrets with gitleaks, checks that records are
  valid and append-only, and checks size and personal data.
- Scoring of predictions with proper scoring rules (Brier, log-scale weighted interval score,
  and a summed deliverable score), compared against a reference forecast.
- Cost and token capture for every model call made through Claude Code.
- `setup.sh`, an idempotent, version-pinned setup. It reads its versions from `athena.toml` and
  `rust-toolchain.toml`, checks downloads against pinned SHA-256 sums, and never stores credentials.
- Documentation: `README.md`, `BRIEF.md` (the requirements), `docs/architecture.md`,
  `docs/design/athena-v0.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/enforcement.md`, `docs/records.md`, and
  `docs/non-rust-files.md`.
